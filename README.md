# Overview of the Project
In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of customer reviews for the Beats Pill speaker, alongside other competitors products, as part of a broader Consumer Insights Data Analytics Externship with Beats by Dre and Extern. The goal was to derive actionable insights from customer feedback using data-driven methods.

The analysis involved collecting customer reviews from Amazon website and performing sentiment analysis to understand the overall perception of the Beats Pill speaker. I used Python as the primary tool for data processing, focusing on libraries like NLTK(Natural language Toolkit)  to assess the sentiment score of the reviews, categorizing them into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.

# Key steps in the project included:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered customer reviews from Amazon website using a third party tool, Oxylabs API which allows for automated scraping of reviews directly from the Amazon websites.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Preparing the data by Identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates and other irrelevant information.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Using NLTK, I performed sentiment analysis to understand customer voice and categorized them into different sentiment groups(positive, negative or neutral sentiments).
4. **Insights Generation:** Based on the sentiment analysis, I was able to identify key trends in customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. This allowed me to make recommendations for improving the product and marketing strategies based on user feedback.
